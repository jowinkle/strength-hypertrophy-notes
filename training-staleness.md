# TRAINING STALENESS

- fundamental boredom with current training
- workouts can be going well
- even if pr's are occuring you still don't want to be there
- occurs over several weeks, not within a single session
- doesn't happen to beginners, their problem is motivation/inspiration
- occurs in individuals that already train habitually
- not changing exercises or rep ranges for 4 to 6 months increases likelihood staleness
- going to have trouble training as hard as you need to
- ability to do the total work required can decrease
- able to finish tough part of workouts but don't feel like doing down sets
## 2 fundamental potential causes
- accumulated fatigue
  - fatigue surpasses ability to recover "overtraining"
  - can influence psychology
- psychological boredem
  - chances of pr's is not likely (fat loss diet)
  - amount of time spent in same training modalities (same training structure for too long)
### Only fatigue comes with other symptoms
  - non motivation induced performance loss(psyched up and ready to go, but underperform)
  - low level chronic muscle soreness
  - joint aches and pains
  - poor appetite
  - trouble sleeping
  - technique degradation
### How to deal with staleness
- if you're already in a position of staleness
  - take a deload
  - after deload, change exercise selections, rep ranges, frequencies
  - try a new goal altogether (strength -> hypertrophy)
- How to prevent staleness from occuring 
  - staleness is okay in peak weeks (probably not training hard enough if it isn't occuring)
  - follow a periodized, phasic plan (hypertrophy -> strength -> work capacity -> power)
  - blocks should only last about 4 months at a time
