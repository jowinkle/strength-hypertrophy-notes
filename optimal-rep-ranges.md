/*OPTIMAL REP RANGES*/

3 independant growth factors
	high workload at a high intensity
	metablolite accumulation
	stretch of a muscle under load
slow twitch and fast twitch muscle fibers occur on a spectrum
	Fast twitch - larger to begin with, hypertrophy quicker, more contractile elements and less endurance elements, good for short distances of exertion but high forces, produce a lot of speed and power with each contraction but endurance is shit.
	Slow twitch - smaller to begin with, hypertrophy slowly and not as much, less contraction more endurance, better at endurance but not much power or strength
super fast twitch - best growth from moderate work loads, high intensities (75% + of 1rm), hard training but not a ton of volume
intermedtiate - best growth from high work loads, lots of sets at moderate intensities (around 60% of 1rm) lighter weights for high reps for very high sets
slow twitch - metabolite accumulation grows these best. high volume does okay
